Heckle

Heckle is a pure-Perl static site generator inspired by Jekyll.  It makes no effort to run on a live site; its sole purpose is the
generation of sites (and other textual works) offline.  Why not use Ikiwiki, you ask?  I'm constrained to use Windows.  Ah, well.

My hope is to make Heckle as pluggable as possible - the entire system should be really just a framework.  Watch this space for
further details.

INSTALLATION AND SUPPORT

Heckle is on CPAN as App::Heckle and is installed just like any CPAN module.
