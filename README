Exegete

Exegete is a set of tools for writing articles about code. Since articles and code are both text, Exegete can be
thought of as a text generator.  Its mandate subsumes static blog and site generation, literate programming tools,
static code analysis tools, disassembers and decompilers (to a certain extent), and ... anything else I end up
finding useful for writing articles about code (including just writing code).

INSTALLATION AND SUPPORT

Exegete is on CPAN and is installed just like any CPAN module.
